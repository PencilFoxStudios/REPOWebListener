# R.E.P.O. Web Listener
A highly-customizable mod that lets you integrate anything that supports sending web requests with R.E.P.O!

I originally created this for use with my Twitch streams + MixItUp to make events happen within our multiplayer game whenever someone cheer bits, but I'd imagine it has other use cases. Check out the config file it generates for options!
